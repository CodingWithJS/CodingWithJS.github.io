const energy_consumption_chart_paragraph = "As the industrial revolution began in Britain and then to other parts of the world there was surge in demand for fossil fuels to meet rising energy demands in industry. This led to fossil fuels like coal, oil, gas to be exploited without considering the impacts of using such resources over renewable resources like solar, hydroelectric etc. But in recent times people have understand the impact of using the limited fossil fuel and have started exploring other unlimited, environment friendly resources to meet the growing energy needs, thereby slowing bringing down the demand for fossil fuels."

const co2_chart_paragraph = "We see that coal, oil and gas are the major contributors in increasing co2 emissions and their production rates have gone up in recent times due to increase in energy demands as compared to other industries like cement, flaring etc. The rise in co2 gases in the atmosphere results in a phenomenon called greenhouse effect which is one of the major cause of global warming. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was initiated by nations to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases which was further strengthened in recent times by the Paris Agreement resulting in a slight dip in co2 emissions due to fossil fuels as we can see from the visualization."

const temperature_chart_paragraph = "With the increase in energy demand and thereby increase in co2 emissions we have been seeing a steady rise in global temperatures across regions and countries over the past 100 years. This is mainly due to factors like burning of fossil fuels and change in agriculture and land use patterns leading to lesser forests and natural CO2 sinks leading to increasing temperatures and global warming. It is said that if this continues and if the greenhouse gas emissions are not cut down soon we will be facing an unprecendented rise in temperature beyond the 1.5°C/2°C  mark resulting in an irreversible change. Therefore lets look at reducing our energy demands whether at country level or at an individual level before things get out of hand."
